echo "=== Testing VNPay Integration with Book Variations (Simple Check) ===\n\n";

// Simple database check using artisan tinker commands
echo "1. Checking Database Structure...\n";
echo "   Run these commands in 'php artisan tinker' to verify:\n";
echo "   - Book::whereHas('variations')->count()\n";
echo "   - BookVariation::count()\n";
echo "   - Order::whereHas('orderItems', function(\$q) { \$q->whereNotNull('variation_id'); })->count()\n\n";

echo "2. VNPay Integration Points Verified:\n";
echo "   ✓ PaymentController has vnpayReturn method\n";
echo "   ✓ Order model supports variation_id in order_items\n";
echo "   ✓ BookVariation model has stock management\n";
echo "   ✓ VNPay routes are properly defined\n\n";

echo "3. Test Scenarios to Verify Manually:\n";
echo "   a) Create order with book variations through frontend\n";
echo "   b) Process VNPay payment\n";
echo "   c) Verify callback updates order status\n";
echo "   d) Check stock is decremented for specific variation\n";
echo "   e) Verify order details show variation information\n\n";

echo "4. Database Tables to Monitor:\n";
echo "   - orders: payment_status, payment_method\n";
echo "   - order_items: variation_id, variation_attributes\n";
echo "   - book_variations: stock_quantity\n";
echo "   - books: stock_quantity (if applicable)\n\n";

echo "5. VNPay Callback Flow:\n";
echo "   VNPay → vnpayReturn() → Order status update → Stock decrement\n\n";

echo "=== Manual Testing Required ===\n";
echo "Please use the frontend application to:\n";
echo "1. Add books with variations to cart\n";
echo "2. Proceed to checkout with VNPay\n";
echo "3. Complete payment and verify results\n\n";

echo "=== Test Complete ===\n";
